# Pre-lecture  
## Normal reaction  
- Normal reaction: force exerted on object because it presses against another object  
	- $\perp$ to interface between the objects  
	- Micro view: springs below block get compressed, exerting upward spring force  
## Friction  
- Friction: force exerted on an object b/c it slides or attempts to slide on a surface  
	- Parallel to surface and opposite in direction to motion or attempted motion  
	- Micro view: springs toward font of block get compressed, toward back of block get extended   
### Kinetic friction  
- Objects are in relative motion to each other  
- Coefficient of kinetic friction, $\mu_{k}$ (1) depends on type of materials, doesn't depend on speed of motion or area of contract  
$$f_{k}=\mu _{k}F_{N}$$  
### Static friction  
- Objects at rest relative to each other   
- Coefficient of static friction, $\mu_{s}>\mu_{k}$, depends on type of material  
## Motion under spring force

- Block-spring system: vertical  
	- Natural weight extends spring slightly so don't set equilibrium to uncompressed length but rather the new length as a result of gravitational force  
  
$$\left\langle  0,\frac{dp_{y}}{dt},0  \right\rangle =\langle 0,-k_{s}(y-s_{0})-mg,0 \rangle $$  
$$\frac{dp_{y}}{dt}=-ks(y-s_{0})-mg$$  
- At equilibrium: spring force and force due to gravity balance  
$$\frac{dp_{y}}{dt}=-k_{s}y$$  
### Analytic solution  
$$x(t)=A\cos(\omega t)$$  
- Amplitude $(A)$ is maximum displacement from equilibrium position (unit: m)  
- $\omega:$ angular velocity, # rad/s. Depends on spring stiffness & object mass, $\omega=\sqrt{ \frac{k_{s}}{m} }$   
	- More realistic to measure frequency, # oscillations / s, $f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{ \frac{k_{s}}{m} }$  
		- Time period: duration of one oscillation, $T=\frac{1}{f}=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k_{s}} }$  
### Speed of sound in solids   
- In a solid, when tug is given, disturbs motion of leading atom, propagating to the right. As you disturb to the left, it propagates to the right. How fast does this disturbance travel?   
	- $T\sim \frac{1}{\omega}$  
	- Separation distance $\sim d$  
	- Speed = distance / time -> $v=\omega d$ => speed of propogation of sound depends on spring constnant, distance mass, distance between atoms   
## Buoyancy  
- Air molecules constantly hit surface and bounce off, exerting forces on surface  
	- Pressure: average force per unit area   
	- More molecules below an object than above  
		- So, $P_{below}>P_{above} \therefore\sum F_{b}\text{ acts~up}$  
- Buoyant force, in upward direction, depends on fluid that it displaces => equals weight of fluid displaced  
	- Depends on volume of submerged object, $V_{sub}$ and density of fluid in which it is submerged: $V_{sub}\rho_{fluid}g=F_{b}$  
# Lecture   
- Kinetic friction objects in motion relative to each other   
	- Depends on the type of materials, not speed of motion / area of contact  
	- $f_{k}=\mu_{k}F_{n}$  
- Static friction: objects at rest relative to each other  
	- $f_{s}\leq \mu F_{n}$  
- Block initially at rest:  
	- If $F_{appl}\leq \mu_{s}F_{N},$ remains at rest  
	- If $F_{appl}>F_{N}$, goes in motion  
- $x(t)=A\cos \omega t$ where:  
	- $A$ is max distance from equilibrium  
	- $\omega$ is angular velocity  
- Angular velocity: # rad/s, $\omega=\sqrt{ \frac{k_{s}}{m} }$  
- Frequency (f): # oscillations/sec, $f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} }$  
- Time period: duration of one oscillation, $T=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=2\pi\sqrt{ \frac{m}{k_{s}} }$  
- At lowest point, block on spring momentum is maximized at lowest point, pointed upwards to balance gravitational force  
- Buoyant force ($F_{b}$)  
	- Upward direction  
	- Equals weight of fluids displaced  
	- $\vec{F}_{b}=v_{sub}\rho_{fl}g$  
	- Depends on:  
		- Submerged volume of object $v_{sub}$  
		- Density of fluid in which object is submerged, $\rho_{fl}$
